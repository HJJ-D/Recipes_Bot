Peel the potatoes and cut them into thin strips.

Grate a small piece of ginger.

Chop one green onion into fine pieces.

Step 2: Stir-fry and simmer

Heat some oil in a wok. Add one star anise and fry it over low heat until fragrant.

Add pork belly slices and stir-fry until golden brown and the fat renders out.

Add ginger, garlic, and green onion, then one spoonful of sweet bean paste. Stir-fry over medium heat until the sauce becomes fragrant and slightly oily.

Pour in a splash of cooking wine to remove any pork smell and enhance the flavor.

Add the potatoes and green beans, stir-fry over high heat for a few minutes.

Add light soy sauce and dark soy sauce, continue stir-frying until the green beans develop blistered “tiger skin” spots.

Pour in enough water to cover the ingredients slightly. Add salt, pepper, and oyster sauce. Bring to a boil over high heat.

Once boiling, cook for about 30 seconds, then scoop out three spoonfuls of the broth and set aside.

Add the noodles into the wok, gently loosen them to prevent sticking. Cover and simmer over medium-low heat for 7–8 minutes.

Pour back the reserved broth, add the remaining garlic and a splash of vinegar, then simmer for another 2–3 minutes.

Drizzle with sesame oil, toss everything evenly, and serve hot.","Savory, aromatic, and slightly sweet",Medium,45-50 minutes
Chive Pancakes,All-purpose flour; boiling water; cold water; yeast; salt,"In a bowl, mix 500g of flour with 3g of salt.
Add 170g of boiling water while stirring until the mixture becomes crumbly.

Step 2:
In 130g of cool water, dissolve 1g of yeast.
Pour this yeast mixture into the dough from Step 1.
Knead until there is no dry flour left. During kneading, you can add a little oil to make the dough smoother.
Cover with plastic wrap and let it rest for 20 minutes.
Then knead again until smooth, cover, and let it rise for about 1 hour.
Once the dough is soft and airy, press out the air — it’s now ready for filling.

Step 3:
Heat a small amount of oil in a flat pan.
Place the stuffed buns (or pancakes) in and pan-fry on both sides until golden and crispy.
You can also add a little water, cover the lid, and cook on low heat until the water evaporates and the bottoms are crisp.","Crispy on the outside, soft and fluffy inside",Medium,2 hours
Fish stew,Fish; onion; ginger; garlic; light soy sauce; dark soy sauce; vinegar; star anise; Sichuan peppercorns; dried chili peppers; oil; salt; MSG; beer; water,"Step 1:
Clean the fish thoroughly and rub it with a little salt. Let it marinate for a short while.

Step 2:
Heat some oil in a wok. Add scallions, ginger, garlic, and dried chili peppers, then place the fish in the wok.
Lightly pan-fry both sides until golden.

Step 3:
Pour in beer and add a bit of water to cover the fish halfway.
Season with light soy sauce, dark soy sauce, salt, MSG (or chicken powder), Sichuan peppercorns, and star anise.

Step 4:
Bring it to a boil, then add a splash of vinegar along the side of the wok.
Reduce to low heat and simmer gently for 30–40 minutes, until the sauce thickens and the fish is tender and flavorful.","Savory, slightly spicy, and aromatic",Medium,45–50 minutes
Flaxseed fritters,"Whole wheat flour; soybean flour; warm water; dry yeast; sugar; salt; walnut oil; flaxseed; five-spice powder, cumin, and curry powder","Step 1: Make the Dough

In a large bowl, combine flour, flaxseeds, and spice powder, then add sugar and salt and mix well.

Dissolve yeast in warm water, let it stand for 3 minutes to activate. Gradually add the yeast mixture into the flour 2–3 times, stirring with chopsticks until no dry flour remains.

Add a bit of walnut oil, knead until the dough comes together. Rest for 10 minutes, then knead again until smooth.

Step 2: First Fermentation

Sprinkle some flour at the bottom of the bowl and dust the top of the dough lightly with flour.
Cover with plastic wrap and let it rise for about 1.5 hours (room temperature 24°C, humidity 80%).

Turn the dough onto a floured board, pat gently to remove air bubbles, then divide and weigh portions.
(For reference: Youtiao 255g, Bread 283g.)

Step 3: Shaping & Baking the Bread

Shape the dough into loaves and let them proof again for 40 minutes (place the pan over warm water and cover).

If using a small 10L oven, bake on a 20×15 cm parchment-lined tray:

230°C for 8 min until golden, then cover with foil (to prevent burning).

190°C for 12 min, rotate the tray midway, keep foil covering only the center.

160°C for 8 min, remove foil and rotate again.

Finish with an extra 2 min bake for crispness.

For large ovens, place on the lower-middle rack — no need to rotate or cover with foil.

💡 Tip: Spray water before baking to create steam — helps the dough rise and form a crisp crust.
Alternative baking options:

230°C for 10 min → 210°C for 15–20 min

190°C for 15 min → 150°C for 15–17 min

180°C for 20 min → 160°C for 15 min
(Adjust based on your oven and desired texture.)

Step 4: Shaping the Youtiao (Fried Dough Sticks)

If your pot is small, make the dough strips narrower.
Use a dough scraper to cut straight lines — press gently with the scraper edge dipped in water (instead of chopsticks).

Pair two strips together, press the center to seal tightly (to prevent separation), and dust the sides with flour.

💡 Tip: Best to shape one, then fry one — keep the dough fresh.

When frying:

Heat oil until bubbles form around a chopstick (medium-high heat).

Gently stretch the dough and drop it in — it should float quickly.

Move continuously to ensure even expansion and color.

For even cooking, dip the center in oil for 3 seconds, then release it to fry completely.

Step 5: Adjusting the Frying

At the start, the color may darken quickly — reduce heat or shorten frying time later for even browning.

Step 6: Reheating

After cooling overnight, reheat in an oven at 180°C for 2 minutes, flip, then bake another 1 minute — it tastes freshly fried again!

Step 7: Texture Test

After slicing open:

With 60% hydration and reduced yeast, it’s firm and chewy (similar to Chinese mantou).

With 68–70% hydration and normal yeast, you’ll get a lighter, honeycomb texture.

Step 8: Next-Day Observation & Variations

After sealing and storing at room temperature overnight, the bread stays fluffy with a savory aroma — the spice flavor may even surpass the flour aroma!

Try making a flatbread version with 70% hydration + 0.5% yeast, add scallions, or upgrade it into a stuffed version with vegetables and meat fillings like:

Endive, bitter melon, and duck leg

Fennel, endive, and pork sausage

Bell peppers, onion, and chicken thigh

Japanese Milk Bread (Adapted from Beautiful Teacher),Egg; Ground pork; Flour; Water; Salt; Ketchup; Yeast; Cooking oil; Barbecue seasoning; Thirteen Spices; Parsley garlic salt; Salt and pepper; Corn kernels,"Step 1 (Batter): Mix batter (add flour if too much water, add water if too much flour). A bowl of batter/water (about half a bowl of water) makes about 4 patties. The consistency should be like yogurt (thicker batter makes the patty thicker but harder to cook; thinner batter makes the outer layer thinner and easier to spread). Add 1 spoon of salt, a little salt and pepper (for flavor), and about 0.5g of yeast. Step 2 (Meat Filling): I used about 100g of ground pork for 4 patties. Season very casually: parsley garlic salt, Thirteen Spices, salt, light soy sauce, salt and pepper, scallions, minced ginger, and white pepper powder. (I even added a tiny bit of millet chili.) Step 3 (Fry): The secret to frying is plenty of oil! You must spread a layer of oil on the bottom. Do not just spray oil, or the batter will burn immediately. Pour the batter into the pan. After a few seconds, pour in the egg liquid (I used 2 eggs for 4 patties). You can pre-pat the ground pork into patties and shallow-fry them to cook faster, or just drop them into the egg liquid. Add corn kernels. When one side is almost done, pour the batter into the empty section of the pan, let it set, then flip the meat-side onto the new batter layer to finish frying. Tip: While frying, gently slide a small spoon around the edges to prevent sticking. Sprinkle with barbecue seasoning and serve with ketchup!","Savory, Meaty, Rich (Egg), Slightly Sweet (Ketchup), Aromatic (Spices)",Medium,25 - 35 Minutes

Mutton Blood and Glass Noodle Soup,"Screw chili (Luosi Jiao) / Zhangshu Gang chili; Pork belly with skin; Dried fermented black beans (Must be included!); Sam's Club white fungus; Millet chili (for extra spice); Soy sauce! Soy sauce! (Salt-reduced soy sauce used); Salt; Songrong Xian (Mushroom essence seasoning); Lard; For Marinade: Oyster sauce, Soy sauce (Salt-reduced), Pork fat/Lard (for cooking); Ginger slices; Minced garlic; White wine (for de-fishing)","Step 1-2 (Initial Prep): (Describes the desired flavor/texture of the chili and the low-oil content of this version). Step 3: Use good quality free-range pork belly. Soak Sam's Club white fungus in warm water for 2 hours. Blanch the fungus in cold water, boil for 4 minutes, remove, squeeze dry, and cut in half. Smash 2 slices of ginger. Smash and mince 7 cloves of garlic. Wash 20 dried fermented black beans and drain. Step 4: Wash the pork belly, wipe dry, and slice to the thickness of a coin (about 3mm!). Step 5 (Marinate): Marinate the sliced pork with 2 small ceramic spoons of oyster sauce and 2 small ceramic spoons of soy sauce (adjust saltiness if using normal soy sauce). Marinate for 15 minutes or more (use this time to prep other ingredients). Step 6: Cut the chili peppers into rolling knife chunks (irregular pieces). Step 7: Do not add oil to the pot. Slowly stir-fry the chili over low heat. Use a spoon to press them to help them soften faster. (I added 4 millet chilies later to increase the spiciness.) Step 8: Fry until the chili reaches this soft state. Step 9: Sprinkle with salt at this point. The saltiness should be just slightly noticeable. Step 10: Must be sautéed until a little soft, completely cooked through. Turn off the heat and transfer to a bowl. Step 11: All ingredients are now prepped. Step 12 (Cooking): Add the trimmed excess pork fat to the pot over low heat, or use lard directly (about 50g). Step 13: First, sauté the minced garlic until fragrant. Step 14: Over medium heat, add ginger and dried fermented black beans and stir-fry until fragrant. If you don't have dried fermented black beans, don't make this dish. Step 15: Over low heat, add the soy sauce! (High heat will burn it). Mix the soy sauce with 2 capfuls of water and pour into the pot. (The diluted soy sauce better stimulates and blends the savory and umami flavors.) Step 16: (Shows the total amount of diluted soy sauce.) Stir-fry until fragrant. Step 17: Switch to medium heat. Add the marinated pork belly and stir-fry until separated and completely changed color, just cooked. Step 18: Deglaze with a capful of white wine to remove any off-flavor. Step 19: Stir-fry over medium heat to allow the flavors to meld. Step 20: Add the blanched white fungus and continue stir-frying until fully colored. (Total time from adding the meat to finishing the fungus is 2 minutes.) Step 21: Add the sautéed chili peppers and stir-fry. Step 22: Add Songrong Xian and stir-fry. Step 23: The chili is still a bit tough. Tasted the chili and it's too bland. Add 2/5 spoon of soy sauce and 2 capfuls of water (the same amount as before). Continue frying, and sprinkle a tiny bit of salt. Step 24: Switch to medium-high heat. If the chili is still a bit firm, continue to add half a spoon of water along the edge of the pot. Continue stir-frying. Do not add too much water at once, or it will become a stew. Repeat until the chili is soft and tender, and the pork belly has rendered its fat and shrunk. This prevents it from being greasy and tastes excellent. (The repeated addition of small amounts of water and stir-frying imitates the continuous heating and reduction of flavor achieved by serving the dish on a small alcohol burner in restaurants, resulting in a tender, reduced texture.) Step 25: Continue stir-frying for about 6 minutes from the time the chili was added. Throughout the process, 5 half-spoons of water were added to accelerate the soft texture of the chili. The pork fat has rendered, making it not greasy. Just before serving, add a little raw minced garlic and stir-fry twice for added aroma.

Passion Fruit Sour Beef Soup,"Beef tenderloin; Yellow passion fruit; Tomato; Litsea Cubeba oil (or Sichuan peppercorn oil); Pickled chili peppers (Pao Jiao/Wild chili); Garlic and Ginger; Salt, sugar, and light soy sauce; Starch","Step 1 (Preparing the Beef—Locking in Tenderness): Slice the beef thinly against the grain (to cut fibers for a more tender texture). Rinse off blood with clean water, squeeze out excess moisture, and place in a bowl. Add 1 tbsp light soy sauce, 1 tbsp cooking wine, 1/2 tsp sugar, and 1 tsp starch. Mix until the beef is sticky. Seal with 1 tbsp cooking oil to lock in moisture. Marinate for 15 minutes. (Key: starch and oil ensure the beef is tender and not tough.) Step 2 (Preparing the Broth—Sour Base): Score the top of the tomato with a cross, blanch in boiling water for 1 minute, peel, and dice. Scoop out the passion fruit pulp (keep the seeds and juice together; about 60ml pulp). Slice the pickled chili peppers and set the pickling liquid aside. Heat the pot with cold oil, sauté minced garlic and ginger slices over low heat until fragrant (avoid scorching). Add diced tomatoes and stir-fry over medium heat until soft and reduced to a sauce (about 3 minutes). Add the sliced pickled chili, the pickling liquid, and tomato paste (optional). Stir-fry, then pour in 600ml of water (or broth). Bring to a boil, then simmer for 5 minutes to let the sour aroma infuse the broth. (Taste: should be sour with a hint of freshness, no astringency). Step 7 (Cooking the Beef—Quick and Tender): Keep the broth at a slight simmer (high heat can overcook the beef). Drizzle the beef slices into the pot in a circular motion (avoid clumping) and gently separate them with chopsticks. Turn off the heat immediately when the beef changes color (about 30 seconds to 1 minute; the residual heat will finish cooking) to prevent it from becoming tough. Step 8 (Finishing Touch—Fruity Fusion): Add Litsea Cubeba oil (or Sichuan peppercorn oil) to a soup bowl for aroma. Pour the cooked sour beef soup into the bowl. Sprinkle the passion fruit pulp on top (the pulp will sink and release its aroma, making the last sips refreshing). Garnish with enoki mushrooms/wood ear mushrooms (side dishes), cilantro, mint, and chili rings. Key Techniques: Tender Beef: Slice against the grain + starch + oil marinade; cook on low simmer, turn off heat immediately when color changes. Sour Balance: Sweet and sour from passion fruit + fermented sourness from pickled chili + fresh sourness from tomato, providing layered flavor. Add Passion Fruit Last: Prevents aroma loss from overcooking; pulp releases flavor gradually, making it refreshing and appetizing for summer. Serving Suggestion: Serve with rice or rice noodles; the sour soup with rice is exceptional. Tastes best chilled for 10 minutes.","Sour, Fruity (Passion Fruit), Umami, Appetizing, Fresh",Medium,30 - 40 Minutes (Excludes marinating time)
