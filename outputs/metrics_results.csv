While it lists 'rock sugar' instead of 'honey' as the primary sweetener, honey can easily be incorporated as a glaze to achieve the desired 'sweet sticky' texture. The other ingredients like vinegar and soy sauce will contribute to the sticky glaze. I've adjusted the ingredients to include honey and the steps to reflect a glazing technique. Candidates 2 and 3 are also 'sweet and sour' but Candidate 1 offers the most straightforward approach to a sticky glaze by using rock sugar which caramelizes well, and honey can be added to enhance sweetness and stickiness.""
