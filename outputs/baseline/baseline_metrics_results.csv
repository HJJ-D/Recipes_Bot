- Candidate 1: ""Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs"" lists rock sugar, vinegar, soy sauce, cooking wine, ginger, and garlic. This would be sweet and tangy, but doesn't explicitly mention honey, and the ""sour"" element might not be exactly what the user is aiming for.

- Candidate 2: ""Sweet and Sour Ribs with Yellow Skin Fruit"" lists yellow skin fruit, sugar, starch, scallion, ginger, soy sauce, and oyster sauce. Similar to Candidate 1, this is sweet and tangy, but doesn't include honey and the fruit might add a different flavor profile than just sweet sticky.

- Candidate 3: ""Sweet and Sour Pork Ribs"" lists ginger, scallion, soy sauce, vinegar, and sugar. This is also sweet and tangy but lacks honey.

None of the candidates explicitly use honey. However, the user's request for ""sweet sticky ribs"" implies a need for sweetness and a glaze. Sugar is a common sweetener and contributes to stickiness when reduced. All candidates include sugar or rock sugar. Given the user has honey, they could substitute honey for the sugar in any of these recipes to achieve a sweeter, stickier result.

Candidate 1 seems like a good base as it has a straightforward set of ingredients for a sweet and tangy sauce, and the addition of vinegar and soy sauce would create a good glaze. The user can simply replace ""rock sugar"" with their honey.

I will choose Candidate 1 and assume the user can substitute honey for the rock sugar to achieve their desired sweet sticky ribs.
